&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BJT is an abbreviation of Bipolar Junction Transistor, which is as famous as MOSFET. Today, let's talk about the principle of BJT.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BJT has three terminal regions, Base, Emitter, and Collector, in the form of p-n junctions learned from physical electronics. Unlike MOSFET, which controlled current by Voltage, BJT plays a role as CCCS which controls a current with the current.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you think of BJT as a back-to-back form of two p-n junctions, you can draw it as above. In other words, in order to make E-B a forward, VBE can be made positive, and in order to make B-C a reverse Bias, VBC can be made negative. The right side shows the mode of BJT for each Bias in the diagram, and it is not necessary to memorize it, and it can be easily understood by thinking of bias as shown in the picture on the left.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BJT has four Operation Modes: Forward Active, Inverse Active, Cutoff, and Saturation Modes. In each mode, Bias is as written in the image above.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forward Active mode can be thought of as a normal operation mode, and further current analysis will assume and analyze this Forward Active mode and npn-BJT.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown in the figure above, when the Forward Bias voltage injects electrons from the emitter to the base, an process minor carrier is formed in the base, and the B-C dropped region is reached through diffusion due to the concentration gradient between B-C, and the electron is pulled to C by Reverse Bias.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the overall flow, an electron goes from E to C and a current goes in the opposite direction of an electron, so it goes from C to E. These properties determine the name of the region, such as Emitter (emit current) and Collctor (collect electrons).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current gain of BJT can be represented by an alpha and a beta value, a ratio of Ic to Ie can be represented by a common base current gain alpha and a ratio of Ic to Ib can be represented by a common emitter current gain beta.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current configuration of the BJT can be represented by a total of 7 components, as shown in the figure above.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's take a closer look at BJT's current gain. If the alpha value is defined as precise, the micro-collector current density can be considered as a partial value with the value of the micro-emeter current density. In that case, it can be represented by the formula shown in the figure above, and it can be represented by gamma, alpha T, and delta values when decomposing by component, which act as current gain factors, respectively. The maximum value of the Alpha value is 1, and in order to make this alpha value unity (=1), each factor should be made close to 1.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equations for gamma, alpha, and delta can be obtained by summarizing through the Ambipolar transmission equation and the current density equation. The following conditions are required to make each factor unity.
<br>
1. The doping concentration of the base should be much smaller than that of the emitter. (n++ -> p+ -> n)
2. The area of the base should be much smaller than the Diffusion Length.
3. The voltage between B-E shall be significantly greater.
<br>
<br>
If the above conditions are satisfied, a desirable BJT can be made.

Next time, let's look at these nonideal effects of BJT.
