# Motivation: The Z-Scaling Bottleneck

[cite_start]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we push the boundaries of 3D FeNAND technology, continued Z-scaling is becoming increasingly limited by **Lateral Charge Migration (LCM)** and the complex interplay between polarization and trap charges[cite: 620]. To optimize these devices, we need to explore a massive design space—sweeping geometries, pitches, and temperatures.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, conventional Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) simulations are a major bottleneck. [cite_start]A single simulation condition can take roughly **1 day** to complete[cite: 621]. [cite_start]This computational cost makes large-scale design space exploration prohibitive[cite: 643]. [cite_start]To solve this, we have developed an **AI Surrogate Model** using Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO) to drastically accelerate the design process[cite: 623, 624].

#### TCAD vs. AI Surrogate: A Paradigm Shift

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference in performance is stark. [cite_start]While TCAD provides discrete data points at a high cost (linear scaling with the number of experiments), the AI surrogate model offers a continuous, flexible design space with negligible inference cost[cite: 638, 641].
- [cite_start]**Simulation Time:** >1 hour per condition (TCAD) vs. **<1 second** (AI)[cite: 635, 636].
- [cite_start]**Acceleration:** Approximately **x1000 speedup**[cite: 637].

# Methodology: Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our model is not a "black box." [cite_start]It is a **Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO)** that learns the mapping from input conditions to physical solutions based on governing physics laws (Poisson, Gauss, Arrhenius, etc.)[cite: 625].

#### Architecture

*(Place Slide 19 architecture diagram here)*

The model takes specific experimental conditions as input and predicts full 2D physics fields as output:
* [cite_start]**Input:** Geometry (HZO thickness, Z-pitch), Temperature, Retention Time, and Ferroelectric material properties[cite: 661].
* [cite_start]**Output:** 2D Field Predictions (Potential, Current Density, Trapped Charge)[cite: 662].

#### Hybrid Loss Function
[cite_start]To ensure physical validity even with sparse training data, we utilize a "Hybrid" modeling approach that minimizes two errors simultaneously[cite: 674, 675]:
1.  [cite_start]**Data Mismatch:** Matching the TCAD ground truth (Data Accuracy)[cite: 676].
2.  [cite_start]**Physical Violation:** Enforcing consistency with Poisson’s Equation ($$\nabla^2 \phi = -\rho/\varepsilon$$), Gauss’s Law, and Arrhenius relationships[cite: 677, 679].

<center>$$
\mathcal{L}_{total} = ||\hat{u} - u_{target}||_{L_1} + \lambda \cdot ||\nabla \hat{\phi} - \nabla \phi_{target}||_{L_1}
$$</center>
<br>

[cite_start]This physics-informed loss is crucial for predicting long-term retention behaviors where purely data-driven models might produce "glitchy" or physically impossible charge migration patterns[cite: 682].

# Proof of Concept & Results

We validated the framework on two distinct device architectures: a standard Si Channel Single FeNAND and a more complex AOS Channel String Array.

#### 1. Silicon Channel Single FeNAND
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AI model successfully predicts 2D physics profiles with remarkable accuracy. [cite_start]For example, when inferring **eCurrent Density** at 27°C, the model matches the TCAD ground truth with approximately **~0.1% error**[cite: 702, 703]. [cite_start]It also faithfully captures the monotonic accumulation of trapped charge over time, governed by our physics loss[cite: 733].

**Design Space Exploration (Interpolation):**
One of the most powerful features is the ability to infer results for "unseen" geometries.
* [cite_start]**Training Data:** 5nm, 7nm, 9nm HZO thickness[cite: 751].
* **Inference:** We queried the model for **8nm** (a thickness it had never seen).
* [cite_start]**Result:** The AI predicted a Max E-field of ~8.4 MV/cm, which matched the ground truth verification almost perfectly[cite: 772].
* [cite_start]**Time Saved:** The verification simulation took 30 minutes in TCAD; the AI inference took **< 1ms**[cite: 779, 780].

#### 2. AOS Channel String Array FeNAND
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We extended the framework to a complex string array geometry with Oxide (AOS) channels. [cite_start]Even with the complex Source/Gate/Drain regions, the AI reconstructed the 2D current density maps with **<1% reconstruction error**[cite: 803, 807]. [cite_start]This proves the model can handle complex boundaries and material interfaces essential for realistic array-level modeling[cite: 816].

# Summary and Future Work

[cite_start]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have developed an AI Surrogate Modeling framework that "faithfully accelerates" design space exploration for 3D FeNAND[cite: 819].
* [cite_start]**Efficiency:** Reliable inference with very sparse training data (as few as 3 sets per parameter)[cite: 820].
* [cite_start]**Speed:** Real-time inference enabling massive sweeps[cite: 832].
* [cite_start]**Physics:** Governed by fundamental laws (Poisson, Gauss, Arrhenius)[cite: 821].

**Next Steps:**
[cite_start]We are currently calibrating the model with experimental data to build a full **Retention Vth Loss Prediction Pipeline**[cite: 844, 847]. [cite_start]Following this, we aim to extend the framework to full 3D FeNAND structures to model Lateral Charge Migration along the Z-pitch[cite: 853, 854].
