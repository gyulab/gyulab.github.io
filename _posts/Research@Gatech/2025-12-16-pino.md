# Motivation: The Z-Scaling Bottleneck

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we push the boundaries of 3D FeNAND technology, continued Z-scaling is becoming increasingly limited by **Lateral Charge Migration (LCM)** and the complex interplay between polarization and trap charges. To optimize these devices, we need to explore a massive design space—sweeping geometries, pitches, and temperatures.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, conventional Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) simulations are a major bottleneck. A single simulation condition can take roughly **1 day** to complete. This computational cost makes large-scale design space exploration prohibitive. To solve this, we have developed an **AI Surrogate Model on NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework** using Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO) to drastically accelerate the design process.

#### TCAD vs. AI Surrogate: A Paradigm Shift
![Comparison of TCAD and AI]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/research/comparison_chart.png "image"){:.profile}<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference in performance is stark. While TCAD provides discrete data points at a high cost (linear scaling with the number of experiments), the AI surrogate model offers a continuous, flexible design space with negligible inference cost.
- **Simulation Time:** >1 hour per condition (TCAD) vs. **<1 second** (AI).
- **Acceleration:** Approximately **x1000 speedup**.

# Methodology: Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our model is not a "black box." It is a **Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO)** that learns the mapping from input conditions to physical solutions based on governing physics laws (Poisson, Gauss, Arrhenius, etc.).

#### Architecture
![PINO Architecture]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/research/pino_architecture.png "image"){:.profile}<br>

The model takes specific experimental conditions as input and predicts full 2D physics fields as output:
* **Input:** Geometry (HZO thickness, Z-pitch), Temperature, Retention Time, and Ferroelectric material properties.
* **Output:** 2D Field Predictions (Potential, Current Density, Trapped Charge).

#### Hybrid Loss Function
To ensure physical validity even with sparse training data, we utilize a "Hybrid" modeling approach that minimizes two errors simultaneously:
1.  **Data Mismatch:** Matching the TCAD ground truth (Data Accuracy).
2.  **Physical Violation:** Enforcing consistency with Poisson’s Equation ($$\nabla^2 \phi = -\rho/\varepsilon$$), Gauss’s Law, and Arrhenius relationships.

<center>$$
{L}_{total} = ||\hat{u} - u_{target}||_{L_1} + \lambda \cdot ||\nabla \hat{\phi} - \nabla \phi_{target}||_{L_1}
$$</center>
<br>

This physics-informed loss is crucial for predicting long-term retention behaviors where purely data-driven models might produce "glitchy" or physically impossible charge migration patterns.

# Proof of Concept & Results

We validated the framework on two distinct device architectures: a standard Si Channel Single FeNAND and a more complex AOS Channel String Array.

#### 1. Silicon Channel Single FeNAND

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/research/gate_charge_temperature.gif" alt="AOS String Result" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AI model successfully predicts 2D physics profiles with remarkable accuracy. For example, when inferring **eCurrent Density** at 27°C, the model matches the TCAD ground truth with approximately **~0.1% error**. It also faithfully captures the monotonic accumulation of trapped charge over time, governed by our physics loss.

**Design Space Exploration (Interpolation):**

One of the most powerful features is the ability to infer results for "unseen" geometries.
* **Training Data:** 5nm, 7nm, 9nm HZO thickness.
* **Inference:** We queried the model for **8nm** (a thickness it had never seen).
* **Result:** The AI predicted a Max E-field of ~8.4 MV/cm, which matched the ground truth verification almost perfectly.
* **Time Saved:** The verification simulation took 30 minutes in TCAD; the AI inference took **< 1ms**.

#### 2. AOS Channel String Array FeNAND
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We extended the framework to a complex string array geometry with Oxide (AOS) channels. Even with the complex Source/Gate/Drain regions, the AI reconstructed the 2D current density maps with **<1% reconstruction error**. This proves the model can handle complex boundaries and material interfaces essential for realistic array-level modeling.

# Summary and Future Work

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have developed an AI Surrogate Modeling framework that "faithfully accelerates" design space exploration for 3D FeNAND.
* **Efficiency:** Reliable inference with very sparse training data (as few as 3 sets per parameter).
* **Speed:** Real-time inference enabling massive sweeps.
* **Physics:** Governed by fundamental laws (Poisson, Gauss, Arrhenius).

**Next Steps:**
We are currently calibrating the model with experimental data to build a full **Retention Vth Loss Prediction Pipeline**. Following this, we aim to extend the framework to full 3D FeNAND structures to model Lateral Charge Migration along the Z-pitch.
