&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The CMOS Image Sensor circuit is composed of various blocks as shown in the figure above. This internship was conducted to improve performance by looking at various circuit designs and simulations of ATOP (Analog Top), called REF, RMP, DBR, ABBG, CDS, PLL, TMC, and PMC, and applying knowledge learned from school, papers, and in-house materials. The design and simulation of the existing designed mass production task were reviewed, and the performance was improved by applying the idea of an improvement plan.

After that, I applied the knowledge that iacquisition from school, papers, and in-house materials. The design and simulation of the previously designed mass production task were reviewed, and the performance was improved by applying the knowledge.
