&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First of all, through the internship, I was able to have a valuable experience living in society for the first time outside of school. After graduating from high school early, I went to KAIST and lived almost only studying for about five years, but I was able to seize for a while and have various experiences and broaden my knowledge. I was wondering about whether to get a job right after my undergraduate or go to graduate school to improve my skills. Through this internship in Samsung Electronics, I realized that my knowledge was much less than I thought, and it would be better to study more and do what I can do well, so it helped me decide to undergo grad school. <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moreover, I think it will be a foundation for establishing values for undergoing my Ph.D. degree and continuing my studies in the future, for instance, understanding the difference in circuit design processes between companies and laboratories. I was able to obtain ideas and basic knowledge for research based on problem-solving techniques in various analog circuits I learned at the company as well. <br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I also experienced a more relaxed leisure life than during the semester, it was a good experience to expand my knowledge through reading, leisure, and travel, which were not easy during the semester. Also, I think that the human network formed with company employees working in various environments and fellow interns will be of great help in future research and social life.
