&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I learned how to handle various EDA tools such as Spectre of Cadence and HSPICE of Synopsys when I joined the company in the third week of March. The Analog IP team of Samsung Electronics' LSI division conducted the Schematic and Layout with Cadence, and created Simulation Bench with HSPICE to conduct the simulation. In the laboratory, it took time to adapt because it was a process that was quite different from the ones that conducted both Schematics, Layout, and Simulation using Cadence Spectre. After creating Schematics in Cadence, Netlist is extracted, and then the HSPICE input bench is created using VIM Editor in a Linux working environment to create input waveforms, voltage, temperature, and type of analysis to be reported and run simulations.
