&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This project is conducted by studying various ADC architectures such as SAR, Pipeline, and Cyclic ADCs, and investigating the principle of how Cyclic ADCs designed by applying to PMC operate in PMC. Subsequently, the Timing Response and SNDR Simulation of MDAC and Flash were conducted to understand the operating principles of PMC ADC and analyze the results to study the overall operating principles of PMC.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are various algorithms for converting analog data to digital. As seen in RMP Block, a method of comparing with the Ramp waveform can be used, or Voltage can be found through Binary Search, such as SAR. In the case of Pipeline ADC, A2D is performed by quantizing the remaining value one more time after quantizing the large amount first. It can be thought that cyclic ADC is the circulation of components in the pipeline ADC through a feedback loop. In the case of cyclic ADC, occupying a small area is the biggest advantage, and it can provide excellent resolution. As a disadvantage, there is a slow conversion speed, and the ADC required by the PMC is an ADC with a small space, so it can be said that the cyclic ADC is the most suitable.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The most important component of the cyclic ADC may be MDAC (multiplying-DAC). As shown in Figure 11, the cyclic ADC consists of Flash ADC, DAC, Sample & Hold, and Rescue Amp. There are two things to consider for MDAC design: Amplifier Gain and Noise Power.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The designed PMC's cyclic ADC sets an ENOB of about 10 as a spec. In order to provide a 12-bit resolution, ADC Output is stored in Logic and the data of 32 times is Averaged. Detailed cyclic ADC operation was omitted due to security. As a result of extracting the data extracted through Spectre's SNDR Simulation with HSPICE and DFT, SNDR was about 58 dB and ENOB was about 9.3. Both Transient Noise and Device Noise were included, and the simulation was rotated, resulting in significantly lower SNDR and ENOB.
