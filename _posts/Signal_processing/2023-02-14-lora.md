# Overview of LoRa

![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/general_research/1.PNG "image"){:.profile}<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LoRa (Long Range) is a proprietary wireless communication technology that is used for long-range communication and low-power, low-data-rate applications. LoRa is based on the spread spectrum technique and uses a frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) approach to transmit data over long distances.

#### LoRa Modulation
![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/general_research/2.PNG "image"){:.profile}<br>
- Employs CSS(Chirp Spread Spectrum modulation)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chirp: Signals with constantly increasing(Up-) or decreasing(Down-) frequency<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually up-chirp utilized on LoRa Mod<br>

- Key parameter: Spreading Factor (SF)<br>
SF(Spreading Factor): Bits per symbol (5<SF<13)<br>
The SF satisfies SF = B · T , where B is bandwidth and T is chirp period. There are at most SF cyclically shifted up-chirp symbols given a specific SF. An up-chirp can be represented as the following formula:<br>
<center>$$
chirp(t; f0) = Aexp[j2πf0+ \frac{B}{2T} t)t]
$$</center>
<br>

The higher the SF, the longer the time on air, resulting in higher energy per bit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A LoRa symbol is a cyclic shift in frequency that is controlled by chirping rates represented with a spreading factor (SF), which determines the symbol’s spreading over time. A normalized up-chirp LoRa signal is expressed as follows:<br>
<center>$$
s(t) = \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \sqrt{SF} \exp\left(j2\pi[\gamma(m) + \beta t/2\right)_{mod B} - \frac{B}{2}]t.
$$
</center>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequency offset, γ(m), and chirp slope, β, are obtained from m, the symbol being modulated, B, the transmission bandwidth, and Ts, the symbol time. The SF has a range of SF ∈ {6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}, while the bandwidth B ∈ {125, 250, 500} kHz. The chirp rate has a slope of fhigh − flow = B/Ts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of a LoRa chirp is shown in the above figure, which depicts the spectrogram of a LoRa symbol, highlighting the cyclic frequency shift. Each symbol represents M = 2^SF bits according to the LoRa modulation convention.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these knowledges, we can make chirp generator program for given domain as follows:<br>

- Preamble -> (Sync) -> SFD -> (Header) -> Data<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preamble: Sync detection, i.e., Start point of the signal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sync: Frame sync, utilized after demodulation - bit analysis<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFD(Start Frame Delimiter): Identifier, i.e., Delimiter, Down-chirp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data: CSS-Modulated data, varying start frequency <br>

# LoRa Demodulation
![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/general_research/37.PNG "image"){:.profile}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically, LoRa detection is achieved in two steps: (i) first, the signal is de-chirped, then (ii) typical FSK demodulation is applied. De-chirping is achieved by mixing the received LoRa symbol with an inverted chirp (down-chirp) with no frequency offset. Since the demodulator has no prior knowledge of the transmit symbols, the de-chirping signal utilizes γ(0) = −B/2. Hence, the resulting signal is given as follows:<br>
<center>$$
s(t) = \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \sqrt{SF} \exp\left(j2\pi mδ_f t\right){}
$$
</center>
<br>
which is a typical M-ary FSK signal. Each symbol is now represented with a frequency shift of mδf, where δf is the bandwidth divided by the number of steps. In LoRa, it happens that this value is equivalent to the symbol rate as follows, δf = 1/T.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the symbol is modulated using FSK, we can use conventional FSK demodulation methods to detect the symbol. Here, we utilized Non-coherent detection, attained by using energy detection in the frequency domain, where the maximum PSD peak location indicates the extracted symbol, formulated as follows:<br>
<center>$$
\hat{m}_{n-coh} = \frac{1}{δ_f}argmax[[R(f)] − 0.5]
$$
</center>
<br>
where R(f) is implemented as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the FSK signal, R(f) = FFT{r(t)}.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using this approach, we can easily implement a LoRaWan-like demodulator by following these simple  snippet.<br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/gyulab/5f53d28e4dc56e6195da004598742dbe.js"></script>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To de-chirp the signal, we start by cross-correlating it with a reference downchirp. This is done using <code>np.convolve</code> with mode <code>'valid'</code>. The index where the maximum correlation is achieved corresponds to the timing of the received data, which we obtain using <code>data_index = argmax(crosscorr_result)</code>. We then perform an FFT on each dechirped data and proceed with symbol-to-bit mapping as described earlier. Using multiprocessing, as discussed in earlier post, can accelerate the iterative loop.



# LoRa Decoding
![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/general_research/69.PNG "image"){:.profile}<br>
The LoRa receiver performs synchronization, frequency-offset estimation, and compensation prior to demodulation. Gray coding, de-interleaving, de-whitening, and Hamming decoding are carried out to recover the information as described in the figure above. In this post, we will discuss the concept of those decoding processes in general and how they apply to the LoRa decoding process.


#### Gray coding
![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/general_research/6.PNG "image"){:.profile}<br>

A gray coding is a mapping between a symbol in any numeric representation to a binary sequence. The particularity of the obtained binary sequence is that adjacent symbols in the original representation only differ by one bit in the gray representation. This property of a gray codes make them very useful in many wireless communication modulations where it is more likely to misinterpret a symbol by an adjacent one than another random one. It is noteworthy that in the case of CSS modulation it is not the white noise that causes this misinterpretation between adjacent symbols but the carrier and sampling frequency offset. In the case of LoRa, the symbols can be seen as integers between 0 and 2^SF − 1 and by making usage of gray coding to map them to binary strings, we increase the performance of the forward error correction mechanisms capable of correcting one erroneous bit in a codeword.<br>


Unfortunately, it is possible to create different binary string sequences respecting the conditions to be considered as a gray code. Furthermore it is just a mapping between decimal numbers and binary string, meaning that once we have found a sequence of 2^SF binary string differing by only one bit, we can still define any of them to by mapped to 0. Finally the direction of mapping of the following symbol can also be chosen freely. This leads to 2 ∗ 2^SF possibilities for every possible gray sequence. The method used in was a brute force approach, which found out that the method of the figure 2.4 is used. <br><br>

> Important Note: The standard gray code being used is given by Cn = Bn XOR (Bn >> 1) where Bn is the left MSB binary representation of n. On top of the mapping using this gray code, a shift of -1 is used, i.e., v = (v0 − 1) XOR ((v0 − 1) >> 1).

<br>

We can note that the gray coding doesn’t occur in the conventional order but in reverse which still holds the property that one adjacent symbol mistake leads only to one bit being wrong. The figure 2.5 present the binary values obtained after gray encoding of the received LoRa symbols line by line. The white and black square are respectively ones and zeros.<br>

#### Interleaving and De-interleaving
![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/general_research/26.PNG "image"){:.profile}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interleaving is a technique used to improve the performance of error correction codes by breaking the correlation between errors caused by noise or fading. It works by spreading the bits of a codeword across multiple symbols, so that if a symbol is corrupted, the errors will be distributed across multiple codewords rather than concentrated in one. This increases the effectiveness of the error correction code, but also increases the latency of the communication. Interleaving can also be used to improve the robustness of data transmitted over a noisy channel.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, LoRa signal applies diagonal interleaving instead of conventional row-line interleaving. The Figure (a) shows the column-major order row-line interleaving of eight symbols. For row-line interleaving, the LSBs (bi,1) of the eight symbols are assembled into a byte. From Section 3 we know that the LSBs of a symbol are more fragile than the most signiicant bits (MSBs) of the symbol. From the perspective of FEC, it is a bad design to group fragile bits together. Figure 9(b) shows diagonal interleaving used in LoRa. Diagonal interleaving distributes the fragile LSBs into diferent bytes and is more robust. We then manipulate the transmitted packets to derive the detailed diagonal mapping.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, we send packets with SF = 8 and CR = 4/8 in implicit header mode. Thus, the interleaving block is an 8 × 8 block as shown in Figure 9(b). First, we assume the FEC used in CR = 4/8 is the standard (7,4) Hamming code with one bit extension. Therefore, after Gray coding and Whitening, the codeword for nibble 0000 is 00000000, and the codeword for 1111 is 11111111. Suppose the sending bytes are all zeros except that the fourth byte is 0x0F, we observe b11 = b22 = · · · = b88 = 1 in Figure 9(b). Therefore the main diagonal represents the fourth byte 0x0F. The one bin shift problem mentioned in Gray coding relects here that we cannot always get eight ones in a block if we directly apply the standard Gray coding. Shifting the mapping by one solves this problem and perfectly matches our following decoding process. By changing the all-1 data bits in the transmitted packet, we can derive the entire mapping for interleaving as shown in Figure9(b). For other parameters, the deinterleaving process is similar. The only diference is that the block size becomes 4/CR × SF.<br>


<br>
> Important Note: From these patterns, we can finally extract the following general interleaving formula: I(i,j) = D(j,(i−(j+1)%SF))where I is the interleaved matrix and D the deinterleaved one.

#### Whitening and De-whitening (De-randomizing)

![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/general_research/28.PNG "image"){:.profile}<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whitening (Randomizing) is a technique that uses XORing bits with a pseudo-random sequence to remove the DC-bias from transmitted data. Unlike Manchester coding, it maintains the same data rate, but does not guarantee the removal of DC-bias, only a high probability of doing so.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LoRa chip datasheet (Semtech. Data Sheet SX1276/77/78/79, Rev. 7, 2020) mentions that the whitening sequence in FSK mode is generated by a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). We guess that there also exists a LFSR generating the whitening sequence for LoRa mode. We apply Berlekamp-Massey algorithm on the whitening sequences of the two decoding orders to obtain the corresponding LFSR. <br>


<br>
> Important Note: The whitening is based around the 9-bit LFSR polynomial x^9+x^5+1. With this structure, the least significant bit (LSB) at the output of the LFSR is XORed with the most significant bit (MSB) of the data.
