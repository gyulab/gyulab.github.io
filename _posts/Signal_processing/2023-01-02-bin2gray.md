&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gray coding is a mapping between a symbol in any numeric representation to a binary sequence. The particularity of the obtained binary sequence is that adjacent symbols in the original representation only differ by one bit in the gray representation. This property of a gray codes make them very useful in many wireless communication modulations where it is more likely to misinterpret a symbol by an adjacent one than another random one. It is noteworthy that in the case of CSS modulation it is not the white noise that causes this misinterpretation between adjacent symbols but the carrier and sampling frequency offset. In the case of LoRa, the symbols can be seen as integers between 0 and 2^SF − 1 and by making usage of gray coding to map them to binary strings, we increase the performance of the forward error correction mechanisms capable of correcting one erroneous bit in a codeword.<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, it is possible to create different binary string sequences respecting the conditions to be considered as a gray code. Furthermore it is just a mapping between decimal numbers and binary string, meaning that once we have found a sequence of 2^SF binary string differing by only one bit, we can still define any of them to by mapped to 0. Finally the direction of mapping of the following symbol can also be chosen freely. This leads to 2 ∗ 2^SF possibilities for every possible gray sequence. The method used in was a brute force approach, which found out that the method of the figure 2.4 is used. <br><br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>Important Note: The standard gray code being used is given by Cn = Bn XOR (Bn >> 1) where Bn is the left MSB binary representation of n. On top of the mapping using this gray code, a shift of -1 is used, i.e., v = (v0 − 1) XOR ((v0 − 1) >> 1). </u></b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can note that the gray coding doesn’t occur in the conventional order but in reverse which still holds the property that one adjacent symbol mistake leads only to one bit being wrong. The figure 2.5 present the binary values obtained after gray encoding of the received LoRa symbols line by line. The white and black square are respectively ones and zeros.<br>
