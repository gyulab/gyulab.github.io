&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided on my major as Electrical Engineering and took introduction to physical electronics in the first semester of my sophomore grade. I studied physics and electronics really fun, and it seemed to suit my aptitude, so I took semiconductor devices, materials, and semiconductor processes in the second semester, and found interest in semiconductors. Naturally, I found out that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are producing semiconductors in Korea.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the field trip, I merely knew that these two companies mainly focused on memory semiconductors (DRAMs), which store data, and that most of the semiconductor market cap(about 70%) was in system semiconductors, and I went on field trips.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I first arrived, I was surprised by the size of the M16 semiconductor plant that was being built in front of the seminar room. Seeing a huge factory that seemed to exceed the size of three soccer fields, I also thought it was a world-class semiconductor leader. It seems to be a new factory that invests in system semiconductors.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, we has been to the M14 building, which produces volatile memory DRAMs that are in charge of fast operation and conducts various studies, and the size of the building is enormous, about 30 stories high-rise apartments. The interior facilities were also state-of-the-art. In particular, I had the opportunity to see the production line outside the window called the glass tour, and almost all processes were already automated, and researchers in dustproof clothing were only checking for machines that had errors. Inside, there were many machines that seemed to perform various operations learned from semiconductor devices such as photoresists and etching. In order to create a clean room, dust is filtered using the process floor, and the level is said to be very clean as about 'class 100' (less than 100 dust particles per cubic meter).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, We saw a silicon wafer that I only saw in class and a silicon ingot, I was surprised that the substrate was larger than I thought and was made of ordinary glass. I also enjoyed watching the wafer with the circuit on it, and each wafer can usually make thousands of chips. When I heard that they are currently challenging the 10-nano process, and now the 7-nano process, I was amazed by how they can put various circuits into the small substrate. Once again, I realize that the elements I'm learning now, MOSFET, JFET, BJT, are really, really elementary, and there's still so much to learn.
    
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a Q&A session with a senior who graduated from KAIST with a little concern about the future, and he said that he was an ordinary student and that he was adjusting well to hynix without any problems, so I thought I should study quietly. It was a meaningful time to think about my career path again in many ways and to become more interested in semiconductors.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we left there, Hynix gave us a mi band from Xiaomi, one of Hynix's clients. I think it will be quite useful for me who lost my Apple Watch!
