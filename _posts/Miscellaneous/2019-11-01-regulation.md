&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have heard a lot of news that the Japanese government is regulating three semiconductor export items as economic retaliation against the Japanese government's compensation for the forced labor of Nippon Steel. Today, we will learn how Photoresists (PR) and Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) are used in the semiconductor process, the impact of Japan's export regulations, and the future direction of Korea's science and technology industry.<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, to make semiconductors, we have to go through various processes. This process is called the eight semiconductor processes, and the eight semiconductor processes are as follows.

1. Wafer process
2. Oxidation process
3. Photo-lithography process
4. Etching process
5. Deposition (thin film deposition) process
6. Dopant/Metalization (doping and metal wiring) process
7. EDS (Electrical Die Sorting)
8. Packaging process

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes hundreds of these eight processes to make a semiconductor chip, which takes about three months to make a chip. Let us find out what processes photoresist and hydrogen fluoride are used.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the photoresist PR is used in the photolithography process. As can be seen from the word Photo, it is a process of photographing a circuit design like taking a picture on a silicon wafer. If we go to a summer vacance with sunglasses on, the part with sunglasses won't burn, but the rest of the part will burn and create patterns. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photoresist can be thought of as the role of this sunglasses, and if you coat the light-responsive PR and irradiate the light, the circuit becomes a schematic on the silicon wafer. However, the Photo process is to engrave nano-scale circuits, and there is a difference that the light used is ultraviolet (UV) for sunglasses and stronger ultraviolet (EUV, Extreme-) for semiconductor processes. Stronger ultraviolet rays can draw fine circuits because E=hc/lambda, i.e. the wavelength is shorter. It will be easy to understand if you think of drawing with a pencil as drawing with a sharp.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hydrogen fluoride (HF) is then used in the Etching process. The etching process literally means a process of cutting down, which is a process of forming a semiconductor circuit by engraving a pattern on a silicon wafer. It means that it is carved and carved according to the sketch made in the photo process mentioned earlier. Hydrogen fluoride (HF) plays a role such as a carving knife that allows the wafer to be cut down. Hydrogen fluoride is etched in various ways, such as melting silicon wafers along the drawings engraved with the photo process.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then why are we so worried about Japan's export regulations? Isn't it a problem to use hydrogen fluoride or photoresist made in Korea? The answer lies in purity. Purity is a very important factor in semiconductor competitiveness. Purity refers to the proportion of main ingredients excluding impurities, and in the industry, 99.999% purity is called Five Nine because there are five 9s. But let's think of using this Japanese-made Five Nine Fluoride and using the replacement Four Nine (99.99%). It is easy to think that it is less than 0.01%, but from the perspective of impurities, impurities have increased 10 times. As such, the probability of defective products is also very high.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a problem directly connected to the most important concept in the semiconductor industry called 'yield'. The goal of all semiconductor companies is to increase this yield (the ratio of normal products), which is a very important problem, with annual cost savings reaching hundreds of billions of won per year if the yield actually rises by 1%. In particular, the purity of hydrogen fluoride and photoresist can never be overlooked for leading companies such as Samsung and Hynix, which are the world's top semiconductor companies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Korea only began to invest in basic science in the 1980s. In other words, it has been less than 50 years since I invested in basic science. However, Japan and other countries have already invested in science since the 1800s, and advanced European countries have invested in science since the 17th century. Naturally, the basic science and technology skills of Japan and other countries are bound to be much higher. Korea's applied science and technology is one of the highest in the world. But the case of basic science is different. Japan has already had enough time to get the hydrogen fluoride or photoresist ratio from 0,1 to 0.2. Up to 100 all have experimental data. HF and PR based on this data are bound to have good quality. Korea has been invested heavily in applied engineering since the 1980s, but it is true that it has not received much investment in basic science, and it has not been long since it started investing. Japan from 0,1 to 0.2, ... We're going to do all the experiments up to 100 and we're going to do 5, 10, 15, ... It has very limited data. Naturally, there will be a difference in purity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, localization can be made through active government investment in the future. However, the latter is much more economical in terms of the time and enormous cost, import and use from Japan, and opportunity cost. Therefore, I think that the localization of semiconductor items, which some people easily say, is too optimistic to evaluate the situation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the situation is difficult, Korean semiconductor companies such as Samsung and SK, and countless researchers across the country who are studying throughout the night are working day and night to solve the problem. Through the efforts of these researchers, I believe that Korea will be able to stand as a semiconductor powerhouse.
