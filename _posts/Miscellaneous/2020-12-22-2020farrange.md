&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year 2020 has just come to an end. I wrote this to look back on this year and make plans for next year while simply summarizing the second semester of the third grade.

<br>

Taken Courses: EE210 Probability and Basic Probability Course, EE303 Digital System, EE576 Low Noise Electronic Circuit, Logical Writing, Liberal Arts: Special Lecture
<br>

+ Low Noise Electronic Circuits

<center>< PLL and DSM ADC, the core of low-noise electronic circuits ></center><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This course, which was lectured by Prof. Seonghwan Cho, was a graduate-only class. However, it changed to a grad-undergrad co-register course this year. It was the most burdensome subject this semester, but it was the most helpful subject I've ever taken in KAIST. I was able to acquire the intuition of analog circuit design and learn various application techniques. I could understand the paper related to topic conducted by our laboratory, such as ADC(Analog to Digital Converter), DSM(Delta Sigma Modulation), PLL(Phase Locked Loop), LDO(Low Dropout Regulator).

+ Digital System Design

<center>< Verilog Projects ></center><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned basic logic circuits, optimization, and simple structure of a computer (Datapath, Register, Counter, etc.). I reckon that I was able to do well without much review because the professor's lecture was great. Specifically, there was a hardware language (HDL) class, namely, Verilog, and a project to create a Vending Machine that satisfies the given conditions as a final project. (The picture above shows the Verilog code in Modelsim.)

+ Probability and Introductory Random Processes

<center>< Markov Chain ></center><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subject was also very easy. Frankly, except for low-noise electronic circuits, the difficulty of the other majors seems to have been very easy. It was a great opportunity to remind the concept of random processing or probability distribution (Gaussian, CLT, Poisson Process, etc.) used in signal processing. I think the Markov chain part conducted in the last few weeks was quite interesting.

+ Reminiscences

<center>< YAMAHA Majesty Scooter ></center><br>
I bought a scooter, and if I drive it when I feel some burden during the exam period, relieved, and overall, the quality of life feels greatly improved.

<center>< My seat in laboratory ></center><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lab where I was almost half of my second semester life! I could learn a lot from the summer semester to the winter semester by staying in the lab. Above all, the seniors and professors in the laboratory really took care of me and they were so smart that I could learn a lot. I'm so grateful. 

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to express my gratitude to those who supported me, and next semester, I am looking forward to participating in the internship at Samsung Electronics' LSI division.
