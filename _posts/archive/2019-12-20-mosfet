&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's learn about MOSFET, which is the most important element that we learned in the Semiconductor Devices course and is also the most used element.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in MOSFET, MOS stands for Metal Oxide Semiconductor, and has the above structure. This is also known as the MOS Capacitor. Metal is a material with high conductivity, and highly-doped poly-Si can also be used. If you think about the Schottky-diode (metal-semiconductor contact) concept that you learned earlier, you can understand it. For Oxide, use an insulator with a large energy band gap. It mainly uses substances such as SiO2. Finally, the semiconductor is a substrate material, and Si, Ge, GaAs, or the like are mainly used. The MOS type is divided according to the substrate type, and if the substrate is p-type, an n-channel MOS is created, and if the substrate is n-type Si, a p-channel MOS is formed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let's look at the FET. It stands for FET and Field Effect Transistor, and it is possible to control and amplify the current flow (=Transistor role) by attaching two terminals (Source, Drain) to the MOS structure seen above and hanging Voltage to this terminal (=Field Effect formation). That is, it becomes a Voltage-Controlled Current Source (VCCS).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is about Accumulation, Depletion, and Inversion. It will be understandable if you look at the chart above.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOS C-V characteristics. Since only Oxide charge exists for Capacitance in Accumulation, only Cox needs to be calculated. In the case of the Depletion Region, an additional dQ is formed in the Space charge region, resulting in an additional capacitance entering the Series and a curve going down. After that, in Inversion mode, dQ is added to the layer excessively closed to the surface, so no additional capacitance is generated, so only Cox is generated and the curve is raised again. In High Frequency, dQ is switched to the Inversion layer too quickly to respond, and accordingly, dQ is added to the space charge region in compensation, resulting in deep depletion, which further lowers the curve.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOS I-V characteristics. ì²˜Initially, Id rises linearly, and as Vde increases, the voltage difference applied to the drain decreases, so that the inversion charge density of the drain decreases, and accordingly, channel conductivity decreases, and thus the I-V slope gradually decreases. Saturation occurs when Vds becomes Vgs-Vt, and the inversion charge becomes 0, resulting in pinch-off. Thereafter, as the Vds becomes larger, the pinch-off moves toward the source. The figure on the right shows the enhancement mode and the depression mode of MOS, where the enhancement mode is normally off device, the depression mode is normally on device, and to turn off, you must add the SCR to the Goxide to reduce the thickness of the n-channel region.

Next time, let's look at some effects that are non-ideal.
