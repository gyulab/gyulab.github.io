Equivalent circuit models are needed to analyze transistor circuits.
Representative 3 equivalent-circuit models for the bipolar transistor.
a. Ebers-Moll model:
- is based on the interacting diode junctions (B-E and B-C).
- is applicable for any of the transistor operating modes
(forward-active, cutoff, saturation, and inverse-active).
- is used for switching applications (turning a transistor from cutoff to
forward active or saturation).
b. Gummel-Poon model:
- considers more physics of the transistor than the Eber-Moll model.
- can describe the non-uniform doping concentration in the base as well as
non-ideal effects such as Early effect and high-level injection.
c. Hybrid- Pi(Ï€) model:
- considers a small sinusoidal signal (i, v) superimposed on DC signal (I,V)
- considers a bipolar transistor biased in the forward-active mode,
- is used for amplification applications.
